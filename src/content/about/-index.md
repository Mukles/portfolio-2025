      I’m an Indian UX/UI designer and creative web developer with a passion for solving problems through simple & interactive designs.
    descriptions:
      - "I am a Mechanical Engg graduate, and curiosity dragged me to learn
          HTML & CSS. Then, I learned UX/UI design, Reactjs and Webflow, among
          many other things. Currently, I’m exploring music and audio effects on
          websites."
      - "I love typography & colours and consider myself a UI design
          generalist. Depending on the project requirement, I try to opt for a
          suitable design style—Minimalistic, colourful, typographic, tech,
          elegant, etc.—while sticking to the core design principles."
